# DecisionTrees
Project (In-Course): Classifying Spatial Data Using Decision Trees

Using Java, analyzed intermixed spatial data using binary decision trees:

1. Created decision tree from a training set of data with well-defined attributes (spatial position) and a binary label which was determined from appropriate attribute tests

2. Defined suitability of a split of the data set by calculating the entropy in each subset of the data

3. Prevented overfitting by using the early stopping method
